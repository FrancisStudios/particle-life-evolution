# 🔵 Particle Life Simulation
#### a version by `Francis Studios`

Particle life simulation is quite a popular concept in evolution and genetics research, as a simple modell that we can study and simulate different scenarios by just adjusting weights in the sim's configuration. This is a little experiment by me, so I get to have a little fun with the concept myself.
